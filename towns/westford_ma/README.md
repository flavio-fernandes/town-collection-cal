# Westford, MA

This folder contains Westford-specific configuration and overrides.

- `town.yaml`: primary configuration, including source URLs and parser plugin paths.
- `street_aliases.yaml`: alias mappings for street normalization.
- `route_overrides.yaml`: add/delete/patch route entries when parsing is brittle.
- `holiday_overrides.yaml`: authoritative holiday behavior for the town.

Update cadence: review annually or when the town publishes a new guide.
